# OpenCV Image Blur Test

A simple program to test OpenCV image blur filters `mean (blur)` and `median (medianBlur)`.

Based on [this code](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.5/dc/dd3/tutorial_gausian_median_blur_bilateral_filter.html) on the OpenCV documentation.

The modified code is on the `src/smoothing.py` file.
